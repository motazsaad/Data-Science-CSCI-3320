In this workflow, a number of ETL operations are performed on the sales2008-2011.csv dataset. Besides showing what ETL features are, the goal of this workflow is to move from a series of contracts with different customers in different countries to a one-row summary description for each one of the customers.&#13;
The one-row description includes: &#13;
   1. the customer unique ID&#13;
   2. the total amount of money payed by the customer to the company&#13;
   3. the countries the customer has been active in&#13;
   4. the date of the first contract (this is always useful to estimate the customer loyalty)&#13;
   5. the number of days between the first and the last purchase, that is the number of days the customer has been with the company &#13;
At the end, each one-row customer summary information is joined together with each contract data row from the original file and the resulting table is written to a CSV file in a "data" folder located in the workflow folder.&#13;
